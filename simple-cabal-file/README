using all this ../Makefile stuff caused to much headache.
Why? You have to register the lib first. Something was broken for me.

So how to use this?

optional (for grepping from current dir etc)
  ln -s ../lib .
  ln -s ../server .

Then configure as usual:

  ghc --make Setup.hs -o setup
  ./setup --configure ..
  ./setup --build

Have fun!


# This only bulids the server! (TODO)
